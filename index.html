                <img src="assets/images/RGB photo.jpg" style="margin: 0px 20px 9px" align="left"> Roger Byford holds an MA in Electrical Engineering from Cambridge University. He held technical and managerial
                positions at the British Broadcasting Corporation and Westinghouse Electric Corporation before founding Vocollect,
                Inc. in 1987. Roger was the Chairman of Vocollect from its founding until the company was sold for $190 million
                to Intermec in early 2011. He was Chief Executive Officer for most of the company’s history, and successfully
                raised funds from angel investors, institutional venture capitalists, strategic investors, mezzanine debt
                lenders and private equity. Roger was responsible for a company “pivot” in 1996, which resulted in a focus
                on the warehousing industry, in which he grew the company very substantially both domestically and internationally.
            </p>

            <p>Roger was a regional E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year winner in 2004, and the Pittsburgh Venture Capital Association’s
                Outstanding Entrepreneur for 2006. He holds numerous US and UK patents.</p>
